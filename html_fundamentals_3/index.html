<h1 class="me">About Me</h1>
<p class="about">Hey there my name is Adia! I'm an Army wife with 3 little boys 6, 4, and 2! So as you can imagine my life can
    get pretty crazy! My educational background starts with a psychology degree, which lead me to teaching elementary
    some how and now to coding! I was born and raised in California, but my family is from the island of Jamaica!
    My mom still has a pretty thick accent. Ya Mon! lol I love to laugh, think deeply, and solve problems.
</p>
<h2>Skills</h2>
<p>Three skills that I want to learn: 1.<span>Web development</span>  -meaning I can take an idea and bring it to life via codes.
    I want to be able to code the frontend (html and css with some cool jquery) and then I also want to know how to
    code the back end. I want to learn how to store data, write applications, and create a functioning website.
    2.<span> Think like a programmer </span>- See a problem and create a way to solve it. Be able to step back and think through
    steps that will enable me to build a useful program.
    3. <span>Organization </span>- This skill would be great to have in every area of my life. I want schedule my days, my house
    my brain! I want everything to have a place and a time to help me stay focused and consistent in life.
</p>
<h1 class="experience">Experience</h1>
<p class="exp">
    I worked as an elementary school teacher and taught 1st graders and 4th/5th grade combo class. Working in a class
    room taught me that there are different learning styles and it is important to recognize how someone learns
    or receives information. Once you know how someone learns its becomes easy to communicate with them in a way they
    understand. I also learned the importance of preparation and preparing for the unexpected. Everyday you have to have
    something prepared for your class to learn. You have to be ready for some to finish early and some to not finish
    at all. You have to prepare for people which is always fun, challenging and a great way to learn more about yourself.

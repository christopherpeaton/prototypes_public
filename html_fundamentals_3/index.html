<h2 style="color:red;">About Me</h2>
<p style="font-size: 12px;line-height: 200%">My name is Tanner Bierbaum. I am 22 years old, and currently reside in San Clemente, California. I grew up in here in San Clemente,
and attended the local high school. I am a California State Lifeguard, and have been serving at the public beaches in San Clemente
since 2009. I grew up in the water, joining both the water polo and swim team in high school, which motivated me to become a lifeguard. Upon graduation, I attended
the University of Washington in Seattle, but later returned home after reconsidering what I wanted to study.I have spent the last six months exploring the world of
programming and computer science, and am eager to achieve proficiency in web development.</p>
<h2 style="font-style:italic">Skills</h2>
<p ><ul>
    <li style="line-height: 200%" ><b>Front-end Web Development:</b> I want to discover what complete and modern front-end web development entails, and how each practice works collaboratively with different
    languages and markup languages</li>
    <li style="line-height: 200%"><b>Back-end Web Development:</b> I want to see how our chosen back-end programming language interacts with the server to complete requests and demands coming from the front-end</li>
    <li style="line-height: 200%"><b>Best Coding Practices:</b> I want to learn what practices are considered most efficient and appropriate according to different circumstances, and how to excercise creativity in designing
    new layouts</li>
</ul></p>
<h2 style="font-family: 'Montserrat', sans-serif;border: 5px solid blue;border-bottom-color: red">Experience</h2>
<p style="background-color: green;border: 5px dotted lavender;border-top-color: black;line-height: 200%;color:salmon;">As a lifeguard I learned to be observant. I learned to identify danger as it developed, keeping an eye out for trouble before it
became present. The long hours in the tower test my endurance, and I grow weary watching the water and the crowds of people. But at the end of the day,
I sleep deeply, knowing my efforts were reason for a day well spent.</p>

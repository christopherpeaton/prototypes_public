<h3>About Me</h3>

<p>Good day, My name is Christopher Eaton.  I am 33 years young, I have a beautiful wife, to which
I have been married to for 12 years, and 2 wonderful girls.  I currently reside in Westminster, Ca and work
at Costco Wholesale and have been with the company for 15 years.</p>

<h3>Skills</h3>

<p>I want to be more knowledgeable about computers, in general.  I want to be more proficient in knowing how they
function inside and out on both hardware and software sides.</p>

<p>Being able to decipher code is another skill I want to possess.  To be able to look at someones code and determine
whether or not is is "good" or "bad", what they are trying to do with it and ways to make it better.</p>

<p>I want to be the best coder I can be.  To be well rounded, knowledgeable and proficient.  I want to be able to
    make websites, applications, games and anything else that involves computer coding.  I want it all!</p>

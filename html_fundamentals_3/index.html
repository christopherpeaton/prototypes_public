<h2 id="am">About Me</h2>

<p id="para1">Hello my name is Aldo Lambruschini, I am 33 years young. I was originally

    it's perk</p>

<h2 id="skills">Skills</h2>

<p><b>HTML5</b>

    This language is considered by most to be a "Must Know" in the web development industry. It will only improve my
    chances of being successful as well as open doors to possible interviews in the future.

    <b>Javascript</b>

    HTML is static without Javascript. Knowing this language would only further my ability to be creative.

   <b>MySQL</b>

    I think it would be important to know one of the world's most popular open source databases.
</p>

<h2 id="xph">Experience</h2>

<p id="xpp" >I've been in Sales for
    the last 15 years. I started as a telemarketer when I was in High School, from there I became
    a loan officer. A little after that I branched out on my own to open my own Real Estate office. So I have some
    experience in managing as well. I started to work at Cox Communications as of 2008 and that brought another set of
    skills

<h1>Nicole Fisher</h1>
<h2>About Me</h2>
<p>My name is Nicole and I was born and raised in Orange County, California. I am the youngest daughter of a family of
        four. My older sister and my parents mean the world to me and have made me the person I am today. I recently married
        the love of my life, Ben, this past summer in San Clemente. My favorite things to do are spend time with my husband
        and family, go to Disneyland, and bake desserts.</p>
<h3 id="skills"> Skills</h3>
<p>
    <ul>
    <li class="skill">Cooking</li>
        <ul>
            <li>The first skill that I would like to learn is how to cook from scratch. This would mean a lot to me but also
                to my husband who is currently the head chef of our household. The cooks on the food channel make it look
                easy!</li>
        </ul>
    </ul>
<ul>
    <li class="skill">Surfing</li>
    <ul>
        <li>The second skill that I would like to learn would be how to surf. Living so close to the beach, I feel that all
            Californians should know how to surf. This would be a cool skill to have and would become a new favorite workout
            for my husband and I.</li>
    </ul>
    </ul>
<ul>
    <li class="skill">Videography</li>
    <ul>
      <li>The final skill that I would like to learn would be how to film as a videographer. Growing up, I used to love
          editing our home movies or my basketball games. The videographer for my wedding was amazing and her skills are
          inspiring.It would mean a lot to learn this so my home videos will be as memorable and great as they can be!</li>
    </ul>
    </ul>
</p>
<h3 id="experience">Experience</h3>
<p id="experienceparagraph">Before starting LearningFuze, I worked at Pacific Life Insurance Company for three years. My daily
        job duties would include talking to insurance agents on the phone, answering emails, and communicating internally
        with other departments.Our sole purpose as a job function was to ensure that all applications turned into policies.
        I would have territories throughout the United States that I focused on to make sure that the process of all of
        those applications went as smoothly as possible. Before Pacific Life, I was a leasing consultant at an apartment
        community in Davis and a small business specialist at US Bank. My favorite jobs that I have had would be In-N-Out,
        a teaching assistant, and a basketball coach for little kids.</p>

<h1>Christopher Eaton</h1>

<h3>About Me</h3>

<p>Good day, My name is Christopher Eaton.  I am 33 years young, I have a beautiful wife, to which
I have been married to for 12 years, and 2 wonderful girls.  I currently reside in Westminster, Ca and work
at Costco Wholesale and have been with the company for 15 years.</p>

<h3>Skills</h3>

<p>I want to be more knowledgeable about computers, in general.  I want to be more proficient in knowing how they
function inside and out on both hardware and software sides.</p>

<p>Being able to decipher code is another skill I want to possess.  To be able to look at someones code and determine
whether or not is is "good" or "bad", what they are trying to do with it and ways to make it better.</p>

<p>I want to be the best coder I can be.  To be well rounded, knowledgeable and proficient.  I want to be able to
    make websites, applications, games and anything else that involves computer coding.  I want it all!</p>

<h3>Experience</h3>

<p>Currently I work at Costco Wholesale as a Tire Installer/Sales/Lead, but have also worked in the optical department
where I was a Licensed Optician.  I stared at Costco in 2000, but only worked there for about 3 months before I joined
the United States Marine Corps.  While in the Marines I learned the responsibility of taking care of myself.  Laundry,
bills, no parents present to lean on, just me and the Marine Corps.  I had many interesting adventures during my five
year tour, one of which was traveling to Kuwait and Iraq for Operation Iraqi Freedom and Operation Enduring Freedom.
I was a Communications Repairman(2844) but also so much more.  Everyone is a basic rifleman first, but also a friend,
part of a family, a brother.  It is the camaraderie i miss most. After I left the Marines in 2005, I was lucky enough
to have Costco accept me back and that's where I have been since.</p>

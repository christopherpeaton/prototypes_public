border-right-color: red; border-bottom-color: transparent;">Experience</h2>

    <p style="background-color: green; border-style: dotted; border-left-color: black; border-top-color: transparent;
    border-right-color: black; border-bottom-color: black;">Currently I work at Costco Wholesale as a Tire Installer/Sales/Lead, but have
        also worked in the optical department where I was a Licensed Optician.  I stared at Costco in 2000, but only
        worked there for about 3 months before I joined the United States Marine Corps.  While in the Marines I learned
        the responsibility of taking care of myself.  Laundry,bills, no parents present to lean on, just me and the
        Marine Corps.  I had many interesting adventures during my fiveyear tour, one of which was traveling to Kuwait
        and Iraq for Operation Iraqi Freedom and Operation Enduring Freedom.I was a Communications Repairman(2844) but
        also so much more. Everyone is a basic rifleman first, but also a friend,part of a family, a brother.  It is the
        camaraderie I miss most. After I left the Marines in 2005, I was lucky enoughto have Costco accept me back and
        that's where I have been since.

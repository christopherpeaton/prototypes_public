    <h1>Mihir Shah</h1>
    <h1 class="about-me">About Me</h1>
    <p class="about-me">I enjoy writing, and all things sports.  I am a die hard Lakers fan; I bleed purple and gold.  Education has immeasurable value to me; however, I am convinced that the current educational model is in for a rude awakening.  As a school counselor, one of my goals is to create a program that can improve counselor-student accessibility.  I enjoy hanging out, watching Game of Thrones, the Flash, and Mr. Robot has definitely caught my attention as well.
    </p>
    <h1 class="skills">Skills</h1>
    <p>
    <ul>
        <li class="skill">Skill 1: Fleshing out My Ability to Think Critically.</li>
        <ul>Critical Thinking is paramount to being a successful web developer, and it's an immensely valuable skill to have in general.</ul>
        <br>
        <br>
         <li class="skill">Skill 2: Javascript and PHP</li>
        <ul>While there are many programming languages, these two are perhaps front and back.  That is, Javascript, along with HTML and CSS is vital to front-end web development and PHP is key for back end development.  To acquire mastery of both languages would allow me to add functionality and complexity to projects.</ul>
        <br>
        <br>
        <li class="skill">Skill 3: Collaboration.</li>
            <ul>Working together and understanding fellow classmates' code and vice versa is a vital opportunity to experience a true work-like environment in an educational setting.</ul>
        <br>
        <br>
    </p>
    <h1 class="experience">Experience</h1>

    <p class="experience">By day, my job experience consisted of tutoring and counseling students in groups or individually to enhance their academic, career, and social elements of their lives.  By night, I was a freelance writer that dabbled in just about any topic, including, but not limited to literature, art history, cinematic history, sports, and much more.  My personal highlight of my educational experience would be the creation of career week at Anaheim High School's Independent Learning Center.  The week consisted of prolific professional speakers, campus visits, and more.

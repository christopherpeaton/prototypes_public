    <h1 id="about">About Me</h1>
        <p id="me">My name is Nick Friend.  I am 33 years old, at the time of writing,
            and I'm 6'7". I enjoy talking about astronomy and philosophy, as well as absorb as much information about
            history as possible. I'm an avid video game player, which I've been doing for almost thirty years, a fact
            that I'm weirdly proud about.</p>
    <h1 id="skills">Skills</h1>
        <div>
            <ul>
                <li><span>Web Development</span>: I want to learn as much as I can about web development.  Since I've found it
                    I couldn't imagine doing anything
                    other than this as a career.</li>

                <li><span>Telescope Knowledge</span>: I would like to work on my knowledge of my telescope and which lenses
                    are best for observing planets
                    which are best for observing deep space objects, as well as acquire said lenses.</li>

                <li><span>Vocabulary</span>: As for philosophy I need to work on my vocabulary, a much needed skill, for I
                    believe the world is moved
                    by ideas as much or more than by actions.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

    <h1 id="experience">Experience</h1>
        <p id="exp">I've been in
            several different fields while searching for what I wanted to dedicate my life to.
            I started babysitting when I was fourteen.  After that I worked at Round Table which taught me people get crazy
            when pizza and beer are grouped together.  My following job was an in-home caretaker, which is my favorite job
            so far.  From that I learned how to be a more compassionate and caring person. From then on it's mainly been
            restaurant work, which my in-home care job helped a great deal to make me a better busser and server.</p>

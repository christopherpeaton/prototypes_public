        <p style="font-size:12px; line-height: 200%;">
            Born and raised in California, I moved to southern California for college and have
            basically stayed since then. Currently, I am the game master among friends for a miniature game called Imperial
            Assault that has a Star Wars theme and recently got into many other board games.

        <ol>
            <li>
                <p style="line-height: 200%;"><b>Java</b> - Java is incorporated into so many parts of web design and can be so versatile. However,
        I realize after many different courses on my own, I am only nibbling at the edge of it.</p></li>
            <li>
                <p style="line-height: 200%;"><b>MySQL</b> - Personally, knowing how to expand the MySQL skill will allow
                    me to incorporate my current passion of miniature gaming and create databases for friends to create
                    and build lists easier for playing.

            <p style="line-height: 200%;"><b>Back-end tech</b> - I know how most computer hardware works, and would like to know more of the programming
            behind it to get a better understanding and build up my knowledge.</p>

            During college, I acquired extensive clerical and technical skills and took those to become a laboratory
            technician for Progene, Inc. Some family issues led to me becoming a home caretaker. From there, I took a
            few temporary jobs which include computer repair and clerical work for the Census Bureau.

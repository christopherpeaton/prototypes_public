<h1 style="color:pink">About Me</h1>
<p class="one" style="font-size: 12px">I am a first generation American that was born and raised in Irvine, California.
    I spent every summer traveling and visiting family, which gave me an appreciation for world cultures.
    After spending a volunteer gap year in Israel, I decided to pursue my undergraduate degree at an
    international college in Israel. I studied with students from over 82 countries, further deepening
    my love for world cultures and travel.</p>

<h2><i>Skills</i></h2>
<p class="two"><ul><li><b>Coding</b>: I feel that as the world becomes more and more digitalized,
    it is not only crucial to stay on the cutting edge of technology but to
    also understand and be able to work with all the newest developments</li>
    <li><b>Time Management</b>: I tend to get excited by new tasks and take on too much</li>
    <li><b>Money Management</b> I have a shopping problem </li></ul></p>

<h3 style="font-family: Arial">Experience</h3>
<p class="three" style="background-color: green">I spent a year working in shoe retail at Fashion Island. While I
    took this job with the mindset that it was an "inbetween" job while I looked for something else, I ended up really
    enjoying it. Other than the employee discount, I made great friends, met interesting
    tourists from all over the world, grew to understand the art of customer service, and
    learned how to start conversations with all types of people.</p>

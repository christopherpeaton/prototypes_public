<h1 style="color:green">About Me</h1>
<p style = "border: 5px dotted blue;line-height: 40px;font-size: 12px">My name is Tanner Bierbaum, I am 22 years old and grew up in a small beach town called San Clemente. I am a big fan
of the aquatic sports; In high school I swam, played waterpolo, and eventually became a lifeguard. When I graduated high school,
I went to the University of Washington in Seattle, intending to study Psychology. After the first two quarters, I realized that
I wasn't too sure as to exactly what I wanted to do in school, so I came home to further develop my future plans</p>

<p>As an ocean lifeguard, my job consisted of maintaining awareness of the surrounding environment and administering appropriate
emergency response and assistance. As a lifeguard, I worked among a group of people that maintained public safety. We
were exposed to strenuous situations and were able to maintain vigilance and teamwork to ensure everyone left the beach in one or two
functional pieces.</p>

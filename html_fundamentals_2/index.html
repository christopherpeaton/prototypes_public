<h1 style="color:blue">About Me</h1>

<p style="font-size: 12px; line-height: 200%">Hello my name is Aldo Lambruschini, I am 33 years young. I was originally
    born in Caracas,
    Venezuela. Yes I do speak spanish. My mother is Italian and my father is Peruvian. Eating at home definitely has
    it's perks.</p>

<h1 style="font-style: italic">Skills</h1>


<p style="line-height: 120%"><b>HTML5</b>

    This language is considered by most to be a "Must Know" in the web development industry. It will only improve my
    chances of being successful as well as open doors to possible interviews in the future.</p>

<p style="line-height: 120%"><b>Javascript</b>

    HTML is static without Javascript. Knowing this language would only further my ability to be creative.</p>

<p style="line-height: 120%"><b>MySQL</b>

    I think it would be important to know one of the world's most popular open source databases.

<h2 style="font-family: arial; border: 10px solid red;border-bottom: none">Experience</h2>

<p style="background-color: green; line-height: 120%; border: 10px dotted black; border-top: none">I've been in Sales for
    the last 15 years. I started as a telemarketer when I was in High School, from there I became
    a loan officer. A little after that I branched out on my own to open my own Real Estate office. So I have some
    experience in managing as well. We started to work at Cox Communications as of 2008 and that brought another set of
    skills

        <h1><i>Skills</i></h1>
        <p style="line-height:300%;"><b>Software engineering and design</b>: I want to be able to create a complete web application from scratch and implement a design for the application that makes it robust, easily extensible, and easily changeable.  <b>Full-stack web development skills</b>: I want to be able to create websites on my own as well as possibly implement back-end technologies for them.  This is for my personal and professional use.  <b>Agile/Scrum</b>: I want to be able to further my understanding of this software development process, which could help me as a programmer and possibly as a producer in the long future.</p>

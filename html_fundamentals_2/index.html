<h3 style="color:#4d9dff;">About me</h3>

<p style="font-size:12px;">
    My name is Sara. I like spending most of my time daydreaming and reading but what has actually been taking up most
    of my time after graduating is work (reality check). I also love to travel. Being able to reach a far off destination
    within a few hours is one of my favorite things about modern transportation. I can't imagine being home bound,
    back when traveling required long hours in a carriage just to visit the next town and months at sea with risk of
    death (and scurvy) to cross the atlantic. Other than foreign destinations I also like visiting museums. The happiest I ever am
    is when I am at an art or natural history museum.

<h3><i>Skills</i></h3>

<p style="line-height:200%">
    <b>Graphic Design: </b>
    I am very interested in learning how to use design programs to create my own designs on the computer.
    My one small regret was not pursuing my passion for art.

    <br>

    <b>Digital Photography: </b>
    Photography is something I am passionate about. I would like to master the use of the DSLR camera.

    <br>

    <b>Web Development: </b>
    As a start, I would like to learn how to create and design websites. I also want to go beyond that and see
    where my skills take me.

<h3 style="font-family:Arial;">Experience</h3>

<p style="background-color:green;color:white;line-height:150%;">
    Part of my job title used to be Newsletter Editor. For the past two companies I worked for, I was in charge of
    designing and publishing the company newsletters. I would choose what content and photos would be included in each
    issue and I also wrote a lot of the content and took the photos as well. I was given permission to design and change
    the layouts as well as decide what to include in the newsletter within reason. I also distributed the newsletters
    via email distribution and print. Being in charge of the newsletter was my favorite part of my past work experience.
    I also enjoyed any customer service aspects of my previous jobs because I enjoy helping people who need my help.

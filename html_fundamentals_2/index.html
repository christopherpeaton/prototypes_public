<h1 style="color: lightgreen;">About Me</h1>

<p style="font-size: 12px;">
    My name is Stefanie Yoshimura. I'm half-Japanese and a ridiculous nerd.
</p>

<h1 style="font-style: italic">Skills</h1>

<p>
    <b>Programming:</b> I'd like to become a competent programmer. I'm very interested in game development and would like to be
    able to implement the ideas that run through my head.
</p>

<p>
    <b>Baking:</b> I have a grasp on general cooking skills, but baking is completely different animal. The science of it is
    fascinating, and also, cream puffs are delicious.
</p>

<p>
    <b>Illustration:</b> I've been practicing my art off and on for years now, but I'd like to be a more capable artist.
    Between polishing my art skills and learning to program, I feel like I'll have the tools I need to accomplish all
    the things I'd personally like to create.
</p>

<p style="background-color: green; border-left: dotted 5px black; border-right: dotted 5px black; border-bottom: dotted 5px black">
    I've had a plethora of your standard retail experience including front line Black Friday/Christmas Season
    experience. I also did a stint at the Business Office of Carmax and learned an extensive amount about car loans and
    DMV paperwork. I've also dabbled in being a freelance artist.

<h1 style="color: #0000ff;"> About Me</h1>
<p style="font-size: 12px; ">My name is Chris, Im 33 years old, Ive been married for 12 years
    and have 2 beautiful girls, Harlow 5 and Teddy 2.  I love cars, mainly
    european and muscle cars, but appreciate all types of cars.  We are hoping
    that this career change will lead our family in a new and interesting
    direction.</p><br>

<h1><i>Skills</i></h1>
<p> "<b>Computer Guy</b>"-I really want to become more in touch with computers.  We use them all the time
    but dont really know how they work or know our way around them, both on the hardware
    and software sides.  "<b>Code Reader</b>"- Knowing how to code is very interesting to me, whether its web pages
    or software or anything else.  To be able to read and interpret what is jibberish to me now
    and to be proficient at reading and deciphering later on is very exciting.  "<b>Developer</b>"- To be able
    to create something out of nothing, using only code is very interesting and exciting as well.</p><br>

<h2 style="font-family: Arial;">Experience</h2>
<p1 style="background-color: green">I currently work at Costco, but from 2000-2005 I was in the Marines in Communication Repair.
    I stared in San Diego, for boot camp, then was in 29 Palms for a year for my schooling.  Camp Pendleton
    was my permanent duty station, but I did go to Quait, Iraq, and Hawaii as well.  Before that I worked at
    Safeway for a couple years as a courtesy clerk.</p1><br>

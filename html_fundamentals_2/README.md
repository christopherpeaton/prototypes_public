### Getting Started

#### Prototype 1 

1. Start using the file "index.php" provided in the same folder as this readme
1. Add an h1 element to the body, give it the text of a title for your portfolio
1. Add a title tag to your head, with the same text as your h1 tag
1. Add an h3 title, give it the text of "About me"
1. Add a p tag, put into it the same text you used from html_fundamentals_1
	- 
	- Go into your prototypes directory, then into your html_fundamentals_1 folder
	- right click on the html_fundamentals_1 folder, click on "new", then on "file"
	- #### SCREENSHOT
	- Enter the name of the file: "index.html" without the quote marks
	- #### SCREENSHOT
	- Press OK
1. Create a basic HTML Skeleton, including
	- doctype
	- html
	- head
	- body
1. Inside the body tags, type the words "Hello World"
1. Test your output.  
	- Open a browser
	- In the URL (not search bar) type "localhost:8888/lfz".  If your MAMP port is not 8888, enter the port appropriate for your system
	- Navigate through the displayed links to get to your prototypes/html_fundamentals_1 folder
	- Your index page will now display.  
	- #### It will be blank
1. Add content
	- In PHP Storm:
		- between the &lt;body&gt; and &lt;/body&gt; tags, add "Hello, I am [your name]" 
			- don't put the quotes
			- replace the [your name] with your name, without the brackets
1. Check your code
	- In Chrome
		- Refresh the page
		- See if your message appears

### Prototype 2

1. Surround your "Hello, I am [your name]" text with &lt;h1&gt;  and &lt;/h1&gt;
2. Add a paragraph tag, and fill it with a short description about your past career.  Don't forget the close p tag!
3. Add a second paragraph tag, and fill it with a short description of what you want to do with your LearningFuze education.
4. In the second paragraph, after the text you entered above, 
	- nest an h3 tag inside the paragraph.  The h3 tag should be the **child** of the p tag, after the text
		- please note that we do not normally nest headers in paragraphs
	- Add the text "Experience" to your h3 tag
	- After the h3 close tag, add a break tag.  The p tag should be the **parent** of the h3 and br tag  
	- Add the text "Todo: fill in skills"
1. In the h3 tag, add a title **attribute**.  title will be the **key**, and add "This is an example title" as the **value**

### Prototype 3

1. Create a new h3 tag, after the existing code.  Give it the text of "Skills"
2. Add 5 skills that you have, each inside its own paragraph.

#### *Hints*

- Test your code frequently, don't wait till you're done to test your code
- Always have your console open while testing your code
- Save and push to gitHub often
	- Save as often as you can it's simple, quick and will save you a lot of headache
	- Push to gitHub after each playground is successfully created (at least)
	- Remember to push to your `js-dom-creation` branch
- Don't forget to ask for help if you get stuck

## Code Setup Details

#####1. Open PHPStorm

#####2. Navigate to prototypes

> Insert this command in the terminal tab

> `cd prototypes` & press enter

> - this changes the directory to the prototypes folder
> - If you get an error with the above command its probably because you are already within the correct directory

#####3. Create a feature grouping (*Create feature branch*)

> Insert & execute these command in the terminal tab individually

> `git checkout master` & press enter
> - The command above switches to the default branch

> `git pull https://github.com/Learning-Fuze/prototypes.git` & press enter
> - The command above downloads the newly posted prototypes and saves them to your local machine

> `git checkout -b html_fundamentals_4`
> - Creating this feature groupings allow users to modify code without causing issues with the current functioning code.
> - Any modifications to these files after <b>branching</b> can be undone
> - "html_fundamentals_4" is the branch name.

## Coding Instructions

### Feature Set 1 - Creating Structure & Content
This is intentionally similar to the previous prototype to reinforce comprehension of fundamental material
> 1. Start using the file "index.html" provided in the same folder as this readme
> 1. Create a basic HTML Skeleton, including
>   - doctype
>   - html
>   - head
>   - body
> 1. In the head link the included `style.css` stylesheet
> 1. Make an overall heading for the page. Something that describes the intent. ex. [Firstname Lastname]
> 1. Make a Heading & paragraph for each of the following sections
> 	1. About Me
>       1. Heading - About Me
> 		1. Paragraph - Description about yourself

### Feature Set 2 - Head Elements
This is intentionally similar to the previous prototype to reinforce comprehension of fundamental material
> ##### Within the head tags

>    1. Have the `<img>` tag link to your image in the images folder

### Feature set 6 - Adding content
> ##### On the skills page

>>  1. Create a nested list with these three sections
>>      1. Technical skills
>>          - Example: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, etc...
>>      1. Technical tools
>>          - Example: phpStorm, git, GitHub, etc...

>>  1. Make the items listed horizontally as opposed to vertically
>>      1. Try using the display property
>>  1. Add some margin to space the list items out
>>  1. Increase the font size of the list items

> ##### All of this should be done from your `style.css` file

>>  1. **DO NOT** use inline styles
>>  1. **DO NOT** use multiple style sheets, you only need one
>>  1. **DO** Use classes and IDs to help target certain elements

## After Coding Details
##### 1. Save files to Git - Add all modified & created files
> Run below command in terminal tab

> `git add .`

> Saving files to Git registers the changed files in Git, allowing them to be grouped together by a message (commit)

##### 2. Package (group) all saved git files with a commit message

> Run below command in terminal tab

> `git commit -m "html_fundamentals_4 - Eric Johnson"`
> - Eric Johnson should be replaced with your First & Last name
> - Grouping files with a message allows those changes to be seen by others as a specific version of the code

##### 3. Allow others to see your changes by uploading them to the Github website

> Run below command in terminal tab

> `git push origin html_fundamentals_4`
> - When running the code above, the Git application will send all commits (<b>groupings of saved files</b>) to the remote location (<b>github.com/[your-user-name]/prototypes indicated by origin</b>), specifically to the feature branch/group <b>html_fundamentals_4</b>

##### 4. See if your feature fits with what everyone else was working on (Pull Request)

> ####Step 4.1 Open your prototypes Repo in the browser
> - The link Should follow this format github.com / [your user name] / prototypes

> ####Step 4.2 Click Pull request tab to open the pull request list

> <a href="https://github.com/Learning-Fuze/prototypes/blob/assets/assets/example/1.jpg?raw=true" target="_blank"><img src="https://github.com/Learning-Fuze/prototypes/blob/assets/assets/example/1.jpg?raw=true" width="350"/></a>

> ####Step 4.3 Click "New Pull request" button

> <a href="https://github.com/Learning-Fuze/prototypes/blo b/assets/assets/example/2.jpg?raw=true" target="_blank"><img src="https://github.com/Learning-Fuze/prototypes/blob/assets/assets/example/2.jpg?raw=true" width="800" /></a>

> ####Step 4.4 Comparing Changes
> During this step there are a hand full of highlighted things that need to be taken into consideration.

> <a href="https://github.com/Learning-Fuze/prototypes/blob/assets/assets/example/4.jpg?raw=true" target="_blank"><img src="https://github.com/Learning-Fuze/prototypes/blob/assets/assets/example/4.jpg?raw=true" width="800" /></a>

>> 1. `base fork: Learning-Fuze/prototypes`
>>   1. For all prototypes this will always remain the same
>> 1. `base: C#_userName`
>>   1. Here you will select the option that matches your username
>>   1. If you can not locate an option that has your username, contact an instructor
>> 1. `head fork: [your_user_name]/prototypes`
>>   1. Here you will select the option that matches your username / prototypes
>>   1. If you can not locate an option that has your username / prototypes, contact an instructor
>> 1. `compare: html_fundamentals_4`
>>   1. Here you will locate the branch name (or feature name) you created at the beginning of the prototype
>>   1. This will usually be the same as the name of the prototype
>> 1. Github.com will let you know if the code can be merged automatically (without needing a manual merge)
>>   1. If the text says something other than "able to merge". <b>Contact an instructor</b>
>>   1. Sometimes a manual merge is necessary, it just has a couple more steps when completing the request (done by instructors at start)
>> 1. Once we have verified #1 - #4 and noted #5, we click the "Create Pull request" button (#5 in the image above)

> ---

> ####Step 4.4 Add details into the pull request
> 1. Give the pull request a title, by default its the name of the last commit (package) message that was saved
>   1. If you set the commit message above you should get get <b>html_fundamentals_4 - [you name first & last name]</b> already pre populated in the Title field
> 1. <b>Don't assign a user.</b> (An Instructor will select who this gets assigned too)
>   1. Further into the cohort we will have students learn to review pull requests
> 1. Click on "Create pull Request"

> <a href="https://github.com/Learning-Fuze/prototypes/blob/assets/assets/example/5.jpg?raw=true" target="_blank"><img src="https://github.com/Learning-Fuze/prototypes/blob/assets/assets/example/5.jpg?raw=true" width="800" /></a>

> ---

##### 5. Collaborate on feedback

> Within the Github.com UI another developer or in this case an instructor will review the Pull Request you made - <b>Is your feature working</b>. Collaboration happens through github UI & the notifications are sent through email when comments are added to pull requests

> - Students should make modifications to there code based on the instructors feedback
> - Instructors will be giving an initial assessment based on the pull request. <b>Any additional collaboration after the instructor has been feedback will be on a requested basis only.</b>

##### 6. Pull Request Closed
> - In the LearningFuze workflow the pull requests are closed to indicate assessment has been given to the student and recorded.

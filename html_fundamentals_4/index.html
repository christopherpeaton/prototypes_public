                    <p id="about_mep">My name is Tanner Bierbaum, I am 22 years old and currently reside in San Clemente, California.
                    I grew up in San Clemente, and from an early age aquatics and the ocean played a major role in my life.
                    I was a member of both the water polo and swim team in high school, and later used these related skills to
                    become an ocean lifeguard. Upon graduating high school, I spent a year at the University of Washington as a freshman
                    in college. Upon further consideration, I returned home to resolve apathy surrounding my future goals. For the
                    last six months I have begun to explore the world of computer science and programming, trying to wrap my head
                    around the complexity and breadth of content. Regardless, I find the emerging industry fascinating, and am working
                    to achieve proficiency as a web developer.</p>

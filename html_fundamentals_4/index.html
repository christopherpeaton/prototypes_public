    <p id="aboutmeparagraph">My name is Nicole and I was born and raised in Orange County, California. I am the youngest
        daughter of a family of four. My older sister and my parents mean the world to me and have made me the person I
        am today. I recently married the love of my life, Ben, this past summer in San Clemente. My favorite things to
        do are spend time with my husband and family, go to Disneyland, and bake desserts. </p>

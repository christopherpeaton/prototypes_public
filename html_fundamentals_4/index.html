            Hey there my name is Adia! I'm an Army wife with 3 little boys 6, 4, and 2! So as you can imagine my life can
            get pretty crazy! My educational background starts with a psychology degree, which then lead me to teaching and
            now to coding! I was born and raised in California, but my family is from the island of Jamaica!
            My mom still has a pretty thick accent. Ya Mon! lol I love to laugh, think deeply, and solve problems.

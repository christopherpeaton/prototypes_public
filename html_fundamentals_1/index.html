<h1>Hello, I am Nicole</h1>
<p> After graduating from UC Davis in 2011, I worked as a Small Business Specialist for US Bank. I moved back
    home to Orange County from Davis where I worked as a Case Coordinator for Pacific Life for the past 3 years. </p>
<p> With my LearningFuze education, I hope to be a Junior Developer shortly after graduating. I hope to use my skills
    that I will learn here and apply them to my everday work life. My ultimate dream would be to be a lead developer
    for the Walt Disney company.<h3 title="This is an example title">Experience</h3><br> Todo: fill in skills</p>
<h3> Skills</h3>
<!-- The purpose of this paragraph is to describe why I have basketball skills-->
<p>Basketball: I have played basketball since I was six years old. I have played in rec leagues as a little kid
all the way up to my senior year in highschool as a varsity captain. Unfortunately I was too short to play in college
    for the women's team however I did play pick up games in my spare time. I still play basketball for fun now and
    again with my husband.</p>
<!-- The purpose of this paragraph is to describe why I have time management skills-->
<p>Time Management: I have great time management skills. I was able to go to school at UCI, work full time, and plan
my entire wedding all on my own. </p>
<!-- The purpose of this paragraph is to describe why I have driving skills-->
<p>Driving: I have never gotten into a car accident or have gotten a ticket. My friends also call me a grandma when I
    drive so maybe that's why I have a clean record. Knock on wood!</p>
<!-- The purpose of this paragraph is to describe why I have baking desserts skills-->
<p>Baking desserts: I make the best chocolate brownies and oreo pops you will ever have. Watch out Betty Crocker!</p>
<!-- The purpose of this paragraph is to describe why I have Mario Kart skills-->
<p>Mario Kart: I have a pretty good track record of placing first with Yoshi on Nintendo 64. My husband and I like to
play in our spare times. Let's just say he needs to keep practicing!</p>

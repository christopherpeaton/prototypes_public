<h1>Hello, I am Michal</h1>
<!-- this paragraph gives insight into my previous career experience and what I want to gain from Learningfuze -->
<p>Last year I worked in the recruiting field for a Jewish non-profit organization that runs summer camps, volunteer programs, tours, a gap year program, and internship programs.</p>
<p>With my Learningfuze education, I hope to be able to get a career in web development. I would really like to work with an application that has both a mobile and web platform. I really find it interesting how apps and website can be seamlessly integrated.

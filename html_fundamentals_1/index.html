<h1>Hello, I am Chris</h1>
<!-- The following extremly briefly describes my career at Costco. -->
<p>I currently work at Costco Wholesale, in the Tire Center, and have for the last 15 years.</p>
<!-- Next I whine about how I have a great job, but do to the physical nature of the job, and the
condition of my "old" knees and other parts, I want to code. -->
<p>I grow weary of physical labor, and though it has helped keep me "in shape", it is now time to
do something else.  Ultimately I would like to work for Costco, but as a coder.

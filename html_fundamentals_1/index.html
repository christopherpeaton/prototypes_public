<h1>Hello, I am Sara</h1>
<p>I was an administrative assistant and student adviser at an
    English school for international students. It is a family business founded by my mother.</p>
<p>With my education from LearningFuze, I would like to become a web developer who can help businesses
    grow in the technologically advanced world we live in today. Many small businesses do not
    have the money or the opportunities to compete with larger businesses as technology
    becomes more expensive and complicated.<h3 title="this is an example attribute";>Experience</h3><br>Todo: Fill in skills</p>

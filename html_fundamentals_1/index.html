<h1>Hello, I am Chris</h1>

<p>I currently work at Costco Wholesale, in the Tire Center, and have for the last 15 years.</p>

<p>I grow weary of physical labor, and though it has helped keep me "in shape", it is now time to
do something else.  Ultimately I would like to work for Costco, but as a coder.

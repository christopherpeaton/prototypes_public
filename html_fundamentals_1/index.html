<h1>Hello, I am Mihir Shah</h1>
<!--Introductory paragraph about previous career(s)-->
<p>For nearly a decade, I have pursued both my passions relentlessly: writing and providing educational opportunities to all students.  I have been a freelance writer since 2006, while pursuing a degree in Literature from the UC San Diego.  After undergrad, however, I realized I could write whenever I wanted, but an intense urge to make a difference in the lives of K-12 students drove me to a M.S. in Educational Counseling.  In one form or another, my day to day activities either consisted of literary articles, reviews, press releases, or individual guidance and tutoring sessions with predominantly high school students.
<!--Why I want to become a web developer-->
</p><p>  While the fields of education and creative writing, from my vantage point, have its limitations, web development is only limited by one's imagination and rigorous training.  In LearningFuze, I recognize the opportunity to fuse both the creative and critical thinking elements of my experiences and hope to make significant contributions not just to the field of web development, but also to education and writing.

    <h1>Hello, I am Adia</h1>
        <!--short description about your past career-->
        <p>My past career is a little tricky to describe. I was a stay at home Army wife/mom of three very active boys for 6 years, before
        that I was a Elementary Teacher. Prior to that I worked at an institute using my
        psychology degree I attained from UC Davis.</p>
       <!-- short description of what you want to do with your LearningFuze education-->
        <p>Im very happy to have found Learning Fuze because I finally feel like this career fits me. I also believe the knowledge
            and tools given here are current and effective. I enjoy learning and I plan on getting into a
            career where I can grow my skills. I love the idea of building something that can
        make things easier for military families.<h3 title="This is an example title">Experience</h3>

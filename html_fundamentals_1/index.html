Hello World!
<h1>Hello, I am Joseph Han</h1>
<!-- Just wanted to share some background about myself for those who are interested-->
<p>I was a Biological Science Major at the University of California, Irvine aiming towards becoming a doctor,
    but realized too late that it wasn't something I wanted to do.</p>
<!-- As you can see from the previous paragraph, I come from a fairly unrelated field of work to Web Development so
my hopes are with the education I receive via LearningFuze I am able to become a skilled and marketable Developer and work
in a career field that I find worth committing the rest of my life to -->
<p>With my LearningFuze Education I hope to become the best web developer I can be, as it is a career path I'm willing

to commit the rest of my life to.
    <h3 title="This is an example title">Experience</h3><br>

</p>
<h3>Skills</h3>
<!-- I feel any work that involves solving problems and troubleshooting requires the person to adapt to the situation and
broaden his mind to any and all solutions -->
<p>Adaptable</p>
<!-- Web Development is almost always a team effort, so being able to work in teams is probably one of the more important skills -->
<p>Able to work well in teams</p>
<!-- Not completely related, but since the world is so connected through the internet knowing more than one language can possible help
gap some barriers between businesses and their clients -->
<p>Bilingual (English and Korean)</p>
<!-- To work with others requires communication and with such a team heavy work environment being able to share ideas as well as listen to others is something
I find important to have smooth work flow -->
<p>Exceptional Listener and Communicator</p>
<!-- Goes without saying, everyone should be computer and tech literate to work as a Web developer, and using a computer for more than 90 percent of my life taught me
how to use the machine -->
<p>Computer/Tech Literate</p>

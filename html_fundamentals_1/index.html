        <h1>Hello, I am Ryan.</h1>
        <!-- Short description of my past career. -->
        <p>My past career involved mostly porting classic games to feature phones in J2ME, though I also ported a early iOS classic to Windows Phone 7.  I also helped create a simple game for iOS, Android, and Amazon Kindle Fire.  Finally, I helped develop a mobile companion app in Windows 8 and Windows Phone 8 for a blockbuster AAA title.</p>
        <!-- Short description of my LearningFuze educational goals. -->
        <p>With my LearningFuze education, I want to develop my professional skills in software engineering, pick up skills in Full-Stack web application development, gain confidence in creating a professional-quality application from scratch, and be more versatile in terms of job opportunities.

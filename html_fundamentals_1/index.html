Hello World!

<h1>Hello, I am David Goodman</h1>
<!--Background-->
<p>I started in technology sales and have a B.S. in Health Policy and
Administration from Penn State. I find coding far more
interesting than anything I've done so far in the
workforce so I'm hoping to make this my career
and I guess my life as well !</p>
<!--objective for the class-->
<p>As mentioned above, I'd like to get a role
developing webapps/websites, and then move on to
native iOS apps or something that I find interesting

### Prototype 2

1. Surround your "Hello, I am [your name]" text with &lt;h1&gt;  and &lt;/h1&gt;
2. Add a paragraph tag, and fill it with a short description about your past career.  Don't forget the close p tag!

4. In the second paragraph, after the text you entered above,

	- Add the text "Todo: fill in skills"

### Prototype 3

1. Create a new h3 tag, after the existing code.  Give it the text of "Skills"
2. Add 5 skills that you have, each inside its own paragraph.

#### *Hints*

- Test your code frequently, don't wait till you're done to test your code
- Always have your console open while testing your code
- Save and push to gitHub often
	- Save as often as you can it's simple, quick and will save you a lot of headache
	- Push to gitHub after each playground is successfully created (at least)
	- Remember to push to your `js-dom-creation` branch
- Don't forget to ask for help if you get stuck

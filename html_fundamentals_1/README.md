## JS-jQuery DOM Creation

### Prototype

#### Look at the index.html file

- You will notice there are three main sections
	- playground 1
	- playground 2
	- playground 3
- Each section contains a `playground_source` div with other elements nested inside
	- This is what you will be recreating using jQuery
- Each section also contains a `playground_destination`
	- This is what you will be appending all of your created elements to for that playground

#### Building Out Your Playgrounds

- Using jQuery recreate the `playground_source` div with all of it's nested elements
- Append your newly created `playground_source` div to its corresponding playground destination div

#### *Hints*

- Test your code frequently, don't wait till you're done to test your code
- Always have your console open while testing your code
- Save and push to gitHub often
	- Save as often as you can it's simple, quick and will save you a lot of headache
	- Push to gitHub after each playground is successfully created (at least)
	- Remember to push to your `js-dom-creation` branch
- Don't forget to ask for help if you get stuck
